# MNIST_DNN
Created deep neural network for MNIST digits with parameters less than 8000 and accuracy of approximately 99%

Improved accuracy by:

Varying number of epochs and batch rate, maximum accuarcy that was reached even with higher epochs was 98%
tuning hyperparameters specially learning rate but didn't yeild higher accuracy
Kernel size of (3,3) and pool_size of (2,2) found to yeild best accuracy
Batch normalization was used to group into specific batches while training the dataset, helps to maintain consistency, yeilding better accuracy
